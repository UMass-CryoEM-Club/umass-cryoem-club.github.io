The UMass Cryo-EM Club aims to connect cryo-EM users at UMass Chan Medical School and the greater Boston area
to discuss challenges and new developments in cryo-EM. We meet on the second Tuesday every other month.

## Format

Each meeting consists of two 30 minute talks. These talks aim to be focused on techniques and challenges encountered in
cryo-EM projects and not be "success stories". Examples are:

- Challenging single-particle projects 
- Tutorials for new sample preparation procedures or data processing workflows
- New electron microscopy intrumentation (phase plates, cameras, volume imaging, etc.)

## Next meetings
