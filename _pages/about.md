The UMass Cryo-EM Club aims to connect cryo-EM users at UMass Chan Medical School and the greater Boston area
to discuss challenges and new developments in cryo-EM. We meet on the second Tuesday every other month and enjoy coffee and baked goods.

## Format

Each meeting consists of two 30 minute talks. These talks aim to be focused on techniques and challenges encountered in
cryo-EM projects and not be "success stories". Examples are:

- Challenging cryo-EM projects (dealing with flexibility, finding rare complexes inside the cells, etc.)
- Tutorials for new sample preparation procedures or data processing workflows
- New electron microscopy instrumentation (phase plates, cameras, volume imaging, etc.)

## Next meetings

### September 13th 2023

Chen Xu: "New developments in volumetric electron microscopy"

Johannes Elferich: "New features in *cis*TEM for in-situ cryo-EM"
